# 📝 Todo App (Vanilla JavaScript)

This is a simple **Todo App** built using **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
I focused more on **logic and functionality** rather than heavy UI design.

- 📅 Add date with each task

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- CSS  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (No framework used)**

## 🎯 Project Focus

This project was mainly built to:
- Improve my **JavaScript logic**
- Understand how real features work behind the scenes
- Practice DOM manipulation without using any library or framework  

UI is kept simple intentionally so I can fully focus on logic building.
